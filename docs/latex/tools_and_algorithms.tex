    We will use \textbf{Python} as programming language, programming in a \textbf{Jupyter Notebook} environment. For machine learning algorithms, we will resource to \textbf{Scikit-Learn} and \textbf{Imbalanced Learn} libraries, as well as \textbf{Pandas} to read and handle the data and \textbf{Seaborn and Matplotlib} to visualize it.

    Because our dataset is imbalanced, we plan to explore \textbf{Synthetic Minority Oversampling} and \textbf{Undersampling} techniques to handle this issue.

    \vspace{0.5em}
    
    For the classification we plan on using \textbf{Logistic Regression}, \textbf{Random Forest}, \textbf{Decision Trees}, \textbf{Neural Networks} and possibly others.
